# Wheat-Head-Segmentation

## Overview
This project aims to address the primary issue of developing advanced wheat head segmentation models capable of navigating the complexities posed by diverse growing conditions. Visual challenges such as overlapping plants, variations in appearance due to maturity, genotype, and the impact of environmental factors like wind-induced blurring make accurate wheat head segmentation difficult.


## Dataset:
The dataset for this project from Global Wheat Detection  we taken photos of Wheat  and then uploading them to the CVAT platform. 

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Global Wheat Detection [data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/global-wheat-detection ). Images of wheat were  uploaded to the CVAT platform for annotation and labeling. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating wheat head segmentation models [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/batoolsmadi/wheat-head-segmentation-data).

### Data Annotation:
CVAT was used for annotation, making the dataset ready for training the segmentation models (YOLOv8 , SAM , UNet).
